      <h2>Production diary - Week 15</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong>14 February 2026</p>
      <p>
        This week I worked on my Github Pages portfolio website. 
        I focused on creating or improving the main sections (About, Projecrs, Skills, Contact)
        and setting up my CS maths and tools page.
      </p>
      <p>I'm most happy with my CS maths, anddiscuss with other.</p>
      <p>I found it difficlt to connect with other subjects, for example, Java and Python.</p>
      <p>Next week I want to improve my skill about creating some website.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Reflective question">
        <h3>What did you actually build or change this week?</h3>
        <p>I created my first website,and try to perfect it.</p>
        <h4>Which achievement are you most proud of so far on your website?</h4>
        <p>I didn't find this point now.</p>
        <h5>What did you find most challenging?</h5>
        <p>When I writing the coding, I'm very worried about the correctness rate because it is same as a language, such as english grammer.</p>
